  VariablePassage: "You can still hear the chilling scream of despair as your #relation#
    presumably fell to #their# death. You start panicking and wondering what you should
    do when you remember the breathing exercises your parents taught you.\r\n\nBreathe
    in, breathe out. After a minute, you collect yourself. Your #sibling# just fell
    from a few tens of feet, but you did not see #them# actually crash on the floor.
    As childish and illogical as this reasoning is, you desperately want to stay optimistic.\r\n\nYou
    want to find your #sibling# as soon as possible, but being reckless about it will
    not help.\r\n\r\nYou <color=\"red\">T</color>hink about what to do."
