  VariablePassage: "As you enter the tunnel, you suddenly become apprehensive. The
    cave is dark, cold, and humid. On your way to the valley, not only did you and
    your #sibling# have to backtrack your steps several times due to the confusing
    layout of the underground, but you also recall several close calls with bats,
    a bear, and several other animals you could not even see properly. The only reason
    you got so far in the first place is that #DescribeSibling#\n\n#They# isn't anymore...\n\nYou...\n\n...
    <color=\"red\">G</color>ive up and exit the cave. You need to stay alive if you
    want to accomplish anything.\r\n\n... <color=\"red\">P</color>ush forward. You're
    the only one who can call for help."
