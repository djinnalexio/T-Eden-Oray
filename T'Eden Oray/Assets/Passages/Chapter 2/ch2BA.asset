  VariablePassage: "You tilt your head up and look at the trees. Branches are broken
    and you can see ropes tangled in the mess. You start thinking. If the carabiners
    held properly, then #they# might still be in one piece!\r\n\r\nYou look closer
    at the end of the ropes and notice that the carabiners are not hooked to anything.
    They do not look broken either. Your #sibling# must have survived the fall by
    landing in the foliage and then managed to unhook #self# from the ropes!\r\n\r\nRelief
    washes over! You now know that your #relation# is alive and able to move. However,
    you still do not know where #they# is or if #they# is safe. \r\n\r\n\"Where did
    #they# go?\"\r\n\r\nYou <color=\"red\">T</color>ry elsewhere."
