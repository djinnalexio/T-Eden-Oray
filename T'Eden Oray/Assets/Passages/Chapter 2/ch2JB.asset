  NeutralPassage: "The pretty glow of the moon is barely enough to illuminate your
    path. You can at least rely on your walking stick to tell you where you can walk
    easily. As you advance through the forest, you notice that it is unnaturally quiet.\n\r\n**ROARRRRRRRRRR**\r\n\r\nYou
    spoke too soon! You turn around just in time to hit something right in the face
    with your stick! It is too dark to make it out.\r\nBefore you even have the time
    to think about your next move, the beast jumps at you again, this time too fast
    for you to deflect. You fall backward and feel its fangs digging into your throat.\r\n\"ARGHHhhhh.......\"\r\n\r\n<align=\"center\"><b><i>Hold
    on! That's not how it went, is it?\r\nLet's read this part <color=\"red\">A</color>gain!</i>\r</b></align>"
