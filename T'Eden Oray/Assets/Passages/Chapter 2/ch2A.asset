  VariablePassage: "After an hour of hiking down the rocky road, you finally reach
    ground level in a clearing. Now that you are closer, you can admire the scenery:
    Healthy trees bearing fruits you cannot identify, pretty flowers decorating the
    lawn of the clearing, and tiny birds going on with their day in the trees, creating
    the calming tune of birds chirps and leaf-ruffling.\n\nYou point out that though
    the sky is still blue, the sun is heading back to the horizon. It will set soon.
    You have no time to waste! You must find your #sibling#!\r\n\r\nYou <color=\"red\">W</color>alk
    towards where you think #they# fell."
