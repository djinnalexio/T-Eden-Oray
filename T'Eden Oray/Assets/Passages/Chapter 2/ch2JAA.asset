    forward onto the ground. You just tripped at the worst possible moment!\r\n\r\nYou
    try to get back up. You can't. Something is pressing on your body. You hear the
    sound again. And suddenly, the back of your neck is ripped open. You cry out of
    pain and despair.\r\n\r\n\"It hurts...sorry........#siblinghalfname#......\"\r\n\r\n<align=\"center\"><b><i>Hold
