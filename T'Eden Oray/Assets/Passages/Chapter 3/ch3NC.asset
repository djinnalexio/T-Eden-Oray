  NeutralPassage: "\"Hey, Manuel! I think it's interested in you!\"\r\n\"Please not
    now!\" Manuel responds. He starts moving to the side slowly. As you expected,
    the serpent keeps staring at him. Your brother starts moving his arms in the air
    in front of the snake.\r\n\n\"I think it's looking at my gloves! Let me try something!\"\r\nYour
    brother takes his gloves off and places them on the ground. He backs away. \n\nThe
    snake approaches you. You freeze and wait to see what happens. The snake uses
    its tongue to grab the pair of gloves from the floor. It stares at you for a moment.
    You then watch as it gets down from the altar, unravels itself and starts crawling
    back the way it came from.\r\n\r\nYou look at your brother who looks a bit proud
    of himself but still completely confusing as to what exactly he just accomplished.
    You must be wearing a similar expression right now.\r\n\r\nYou look forward and
