  NeutralPassage: 
  VariablePassage: "Suddenly, the ground starts shaking again. However, this time,
    it seems even more violent and loud than the previous one. Your #sibling# and
    you firmly grip each other for balance.\r\n\r\nAnd then, you see it. From the
    dark woods, a massive white snake appears. It moves in circles around the altar.
    Its scales contrast with the ambient darkness and shine in the moonlight. After
    the third round of the altar, you can finally see its tail exiting the bushes.
    The snake now raises its head to look down on you. You finally have a good look
    at the beast: long enough to coil several times around the altar, a girth making
    it heavy enough to flatten the ground on its path, and a hood large enough to
    block part of the abundant moonlight. The giant cobra casts its shadow over the
    altar.\r\n\r\nYou <color=\"red\">A</color>ssess your situation."
